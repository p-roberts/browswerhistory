            <h2> A brief history of Firefox </h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/"></a> The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite 
                called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002
                under the name Phoenix.
                
                Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to 
                defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the 
                blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to "switch to a different search 
                provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.
